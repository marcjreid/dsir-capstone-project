# Project  - Pokemon Image Classification 


## Problem Statement
The goal of my project is to find a way for card collectors to link their collection
with their online accounts or just to store their cards electronically. Typing in Pokemonnames on 
a phone or table can be cumbersome and the ability to scan an image of a card to find out
how much it is worth would be very useful to players and collectors. This is also a good 
opportunity to learn how Nueral Networks best learn patterns to classify images.
